## **INTRODUCTION :**

*A personal diary is one which is much needed by any one in this world. The one person who is going to listen to us without any judgements is a personal diary.
so, i thought of making an application which would make note of these datas and can be kept for life.
Many of us loose our precious things by carelessness. But when it comes to this application the data is stored , viewed, retrived and even deleted. This diary also comes with a username and password through which the datas are secured.
I have used C programming language which allows you to edit, view, change password etc... This application can run in linux also..
